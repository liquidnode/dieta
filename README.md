# DIETA
DIETA (DIETA Ist Ein Tolles Akronym) is a software for quantum cluster simulations.
It is able to calculate excitation spectra of spin/bosonic/fermionic systems using 
Cluster Perturbation Theory/Bosonic Self-Energy Functional Theory/Variational Cluster Approach.
See the examples folder for a few use cases of this program.


To compile DIETA you need:
- the linear algebra library Eigen
- the C++ Mathematical Expression Parsing And Evaluation Library exprtk
